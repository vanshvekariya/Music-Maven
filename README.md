# Music-Maven

The goal of this project is to create a music-specific chatbot that is able to also play and analyze music as part of the conversation. The idea is to utilize open source and commercial LLMs to create structured queries to train a music-specific LLM as well as various ways of asking the same question. It will also be able to analyze audio recordings and then combine the analyzed information with knowledge obtained from the LLM to respond in interesting ways to queries.
